                <p>This documentation will get you started on the basics of setting up GitHub on your local machine. I am also assuming you have a basic idea of what GitHub is and a basic understanding of how it works. I will go over just the basic commands and how to work with GitHub in VSCode. I am a VSCode user and I use <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">Git Bash</a> as my integrated terminal. I hope this is helpful for anyone that is having a hard time setting up Git within VSCode. I was a little confused in the beginning, but as soon as I figured it out, it was a piece of cake!</p>
                <p>By the end of this, you will learn to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Set up github on your local machine</li>
                    <li>Use the command line to push and commit to github</li>
                    <li>Setup a .gitignore file</li>
                    <li>Connect to your repository with the command line</li>
                    <li>Check status of files of staged files</li>

                <header>Get the Git</header>
                <p>First of all, you need to download the appropriate files to begin the setup proccess. Assuming you already have VSCode installed on your machine, let's grab the git software:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If you don't already have a GitHub account, make sure you go create one at <a href="http://github.com">GitHub.com</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">Git v2.17.1</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://desktop.github.com/">GitHub desktop application</a> (You don't NEED this to procceed, but it is nice to have on your machine). All of the default settings and checkboxes are FINE when installing Git. In the second prompt where it asks to choose default editor, you can choose VsCode.</li>
                    <li><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/?wt.mc_id=adw-brand&gclid=Cj0KCQjw6pLZBRCxARIsALaaY9b2I1WM3Ft3XiMYSBCm8WNuHgT1oGgBjpi1oD25g5_tx44IiFpm9XkaAghAEALw_wcB">VSCode</a> (just in case you don't already have it)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Install Git in an easy to find spot on your PC. I installed mine on my D: drive inside an empty folder named Git.  I recommend using the drive you save most of your projects on.</p>
                <p>Same thing with the desktop app, that one lives in it's own file and a shortcut resides on my desktop.</p>

                        <header>What is CSS?</header>
                        <p>Web browsers apply CSS rules to a document to affect how they are displayed. A CSS rule is formed from:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A set of properties, which have values set to update how the HTML content is displayed, for example I want my element's width to be 50% of its parent element, and its background to be red.</li>
                            <li>A selector, which selects the element(s) you want to apply the updated property values to. For example, I want to apply my CSS rule to all the paragraphs in my HTML document.</li>
                        </ul>
                            <p>A set of CSS rules contained within a stylesheet determines how a webpage should look.</p>

                            <header>CSS Example</header>
                            <p>The above descriptions may or may not have made sense, so let's make sure things are clear by presenting a quick example. First of all, let's take a simple HTML document, containing an &lt; h1 &gt; and a &lt; p &gt; (notice that a stylesheet is applied to the HTML using a &lt; link &gt; element):</p>
                            <pre>
                            <code>
h1 {
      color: blue;
      background-color: yellow;
      border: 1px solid black;
    }
    
p {
      color: red;
    }                                   
                            </code>
                            </pre>
                                <p>The first rule starts with an h1 selector, which means that it will apply its property values to the <h1> element. It contains three properties and their values (each property/value pair is called a declaration):</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>The first one sets the text color to blue.</li>
                                        <li>The second sets the background color to yellow.</li>
                                        <li>The third one puts a border around the header that is 1 pixel wide, solid (not dotted, or dashed, etc.), and colored black.</li>
                                    </ul>
